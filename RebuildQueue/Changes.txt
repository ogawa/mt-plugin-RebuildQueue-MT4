Version 1.06 - May 14, 2007

* Bug fixes

Version 1.05 - May 5, 2007

* Added RebuildQueue-List.pl, which exposes the pages in the Queue through 
  a filterable interface

Version 1.04 - January 16, 2007

* Fixed a bug that affected rebuilds of date-based archives (thanks to
  David Raynes for tracking this one down).

Version 1.03 - August 31, 2006

* Fixed a bug related to syncing uploaded files.

Version 1.02 - August 16, 2006

* Added '-load' parameter for RebuildQueue.pl script to define how many
  queue items at most to process for a given rebuild set (default is now
  10; previously this was a constant of 1000).
* Improved rules for bypassing rebuild queue during save/rebuild of
  templates or forced site rebuilds.
* Improved selection and sorting of queued items (sorts by priority then by
  time placed in the queue).

Version 1.01 - August 15, 2006

* Added support for comma-delimited IDs for RebuildQueue.pl's worker
  parameter.
* RebuildQueue 'sync' mode can now be daemonized (with support for sleep
  parameter).
* RebuildQueue now handles synchronization for files uploaded through
  MT interface ("Upload File").
* Number of workers can be configured beyond the arbitrary limit of 10
  (configure for 10 and save to have the limit increased).
* Added system configuration option for syncing (if you don't sync, you
  can leave this option unchecked).
* Queued items are now assigned a default priority that gives preference
  to building of permalinked pages, then main indexes, then dated archives,
  then category archives, then everything else.
* Cleaned up RebuildQueue::Plugin a bit and added some POD documentation
  on how queue items can be manipulated by another plugin to better
  tune prioritization and scheduling of builds.

Version 1.0 - August 12, 2006

* Initial release.
